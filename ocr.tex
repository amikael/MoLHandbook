\section{Optical Character Recognition}
%Editor:Andr\'as Kornai
%version: synopsis


Chapter 2.7 will deal with the recognition of writing by computer, usually
called Optical Character Recognition or OCR for short \citep{Bunke:1997}.

We discuss dynamic versus static, handwritten versus machine print OCR, with
special emphasis on the problems that have no counterpart in speech
recognition such as {\it page decomposition} \citep{OGorman:1995}

We also cover the main types of writing and scripts \citep{Sproat:2000}, the
peculaiar difficulties associated to each, and the role of OCR in the
transmission of cultural heritage to the digital age.

{\it OCR may make more sense as a subchapter of the speech reco chapter}
